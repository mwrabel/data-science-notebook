Leo Breiman: Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures

http://itp.wceruw.org/documents/ModelingCulturePresentation.pdf
based on Christoph Molnar's presentation

1. Statistics: Data Modeling Culture
  - revealing associations (better understand data)
  - predicting
  - design experiments, visualise data, explaining y...
2. Machine Learning: Algorithmic Modeling Culture
  - develop algorithm as close to real-world data generation process as possible
  - prediction
  - minimizing loss function


Drawbacks:
1. Data Modeling Culture
  - assumptions often violated
  - often no model evaluation
  - conclusions on model, not nature
  - fail in areas like speech or image recognition

2. Algorithmic Modeling Culture
  - do not explain anything
  - overfitting -> TRAINING vs TESTING vs VALIDATING
  - higher the dimensionality = more difficult signal vs. noise separation -> FEATURE SELECTION
  - 


Rashomon effect: (Often) Many different models describe a situation equally accurate.
Rashomon is a Japanese movie in which four witnesses tell different versions of a crime. All versions account for the facts but they contradict each other.
Rashomon effect can be exploited by aggregating over many models

Trade-off between interpretability (Data Modeling Culture) and predictive accuracy (Algorithmic Modeling Culture)

Data Modeling Culture: model evaluated on training data
Algorithmic Modeling Culture: model evaluated on testing data / CV


Data analysts should:
→ Use predictive accuracy to evaluate models
→ Seek the best model
→ Add Machine Learning to their toolbox
