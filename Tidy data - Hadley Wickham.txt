https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10/

Tidy data:
Every variable in different column
Every observation in new row
Every type of observational unit forms table 

Messy data:
Every other type of data. You may need messy data sometimes.

However, in general tidy data enables a painless transition to:
Manipulation
Visualisation
Modeling

Example of tidy data:
id artist 		track 					time
1  2 Pac 		Baby Don't Cry 			4:22
2  2Ge+her 		The Hardest Part Of ... 3:15
3  3 Doors Down Kryptonite 				3:53
