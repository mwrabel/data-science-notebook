BIG DATA / MODEL
Estimation + Projection + Prediction + Optimization

Measure customer acquisition

Challenge: TV Brand Advertisers expect TV Ad to work during next purchase cycle for the product (in case of toothpaste it may be next month, whereas in case of sportscar it could be 30 years)
Challenge: App Marketers expect TV Ad to work immediately, to propell in-app purchases/app downloads. E-commerce business: counting on impulsive purchases
Challenge: planned airing time differs from actual, TV not a real-time media in terms of reporting

not one baseline, but baseline calculated directly prior to ad airing

Model should calculate:
individual attribution window per TV ad airing
An individual baseline per TV ad airing
The correct attribution when TV airings overlap

How to optimise TV Ad ROI?
- optimise continuously
- use test campaigns to measure impact of targeted/non-targeted audiences (prior to scaling campaign up)
- test different TV creatives
