Software development skills for data scientists - Trey Causey
http://treycausey.com/software_dev_skills.html

Data Scientist (DS) don't get same training as Software Developers <- cause for alarm
DSs don't do: checking / testing / code review (usually)
SDs take those skills for granted
"many new data scientists don't know how to effectively collaborate"

DRY - don't repeat yourself. Write functions instead and reuse code
"rule of thumb: if you find yourself writing the same line of code with only minor changes each time, think about how you can turn that code into a function that takes the changes as parameters"
---> refactoring

Good comments explain WHAT you are doing and WHY 
update your comments while you update your code!

Version control / source / revision control
git / subversion / mercurial
There are only three certainties in your life as a data scientist: death, taxes, and an inevitable git clusterfuck. In that case: git reset --hard 

Testing
unit test - most basic type of test
write code that checks your code
possbile bugs: not enough data, missing columns, memory overload, network barfed
WHY? you may even not be awake when your code runs
automate testing, create logfiles
need logging to be able to debug & recreate bug conditions
Disk space is cheap
